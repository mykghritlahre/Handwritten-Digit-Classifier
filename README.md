# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
This repository contains a Handwritten Digit Classifier built using machine learning. The model is trained to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the popular MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model for digit recognition
